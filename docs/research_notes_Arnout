To read up on block chain and smart contracts i watched several videos on youtube about blockchain,
read about it and ethereum on https://blockgeeks.com/guides/ethereum/ and related articles like proof of work vs proof of stake
read the original blockchain paper, basic understanding about blockchain
Christidis, K., & Devetsikiotis, M. (2016). Blockchains and smart contracts for the internet of things. Ieee Access, 4, 2292-2303.   references multiple different blockchain technologies and gives some examples of pros and cons
Luu, L., Chu, D. H., Olickel, H., Saxena, P., & Hobor, A. (2016, October). Making smart contracts smarter. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (pp. 254-269). ACM. A paper explaining common problems in smart contracts and proposing a solution.
Vukolić, M. (2015, October). The quest for scalable blockchain fabric: Proof-of-work vs. BFT replication. In International workshop on open problems in network security (pp. 112-125). Springer, Cham. I mainly read the opening where blockchain is explained as this was 1 of the first papers I read.
I skimmed various other papers but did not keep a good record of this so it will not be included here.

Zheng, Zibin, et al. "Blockchain challenges and opportunities: A survey." Work Pap.–2016 (2016).
lists qualities of different types of blockchain, also lists application domains of blockchain with different exmaples from different sectors such as security, public service and IoT
They also come up with a list of challenges that blockchain faces with possible solutions problems are in scalability, privacy and selfish mining (also something about AI and smart contracts)

Bartoletti, Massimo, and Livio Pompianu. "An empirical analysis of smart contracts: platforms, applications, and design patterns." International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security. Springer, Cham, 2017.
lists available platforms for smart contracts + characteristics; Also lists current bitcoin/ether contract uses. Design patterns for contracts and there use are also in here such as oracles
I thought proof of burn was an interesting concept.

Mason, J. (2017). Intelligent contracts and the construction industry. Journal of Legal Affairs and Dispute Resolution in Engineering and Construction, 9(3), 04517012.
Interesting section on history of smart contracts -> makes distinction between smart and inteligent contracts, could possibly be used to create full automation of contracts in construction sector using BIM (building information model) as a setup towards this. Would solve some of the problems in constuction regarding topics such as accountability.

Thomas, L., Long, C., Burnap, P., Wu, J., & Jenkins, N. (2017). Automation of the supplier role in the GB power system using blockchain-based smart contracts. CIRED-Open Access Proceedings Journal, 2017(1), 2619-2623.
About using smart contracts in GB for doing energy deals.

Szabo, N. (1997). Formalizing and securing relationships on public networks. First Monday, 2(9).
First paper I could find coining the term smart contract (although this is from 1997 not 1994) which i saw mentioned all over the internet. 
But maybe this exists ?: Szabo, N. (1994). ԓmart contracts.ԍ

An efficient scheme for applying software updates in pervasive computing applications.
IoT proposing a distributed aproach for software updates over a centralized one

Garcia Lopez, P., Montresor, A., Epema, D., Datta, A., Higashino, T., Iamnitchi, A., ... & Riviere, E. (2015). Edge-centric computing: Vision and challenges. ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 45(5), 37-42.
makes statements about centralized and decentralized computing.

Peak, D. A., & Azadmanesh, M. H. (1997). Centralization/decentralization cycles in computing: Market evidence. Information & Management, 31(6), 303-317.
Paper sugests that waves exist of centralization and decentralization where 1 of the 2 is more dominant for a time and then the other one gain popularity again.
