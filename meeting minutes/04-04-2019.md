## Meeting notes
10:45 until 11:45 presentation 18th of april

Group decided to not do the implementation.

### TODO
Process feedback and finalize paper, and send it to Martijn for a last review.

#### Feedback paper
The paper needs to have some examples of real world applications of the techniques the paper talks about.

Paper should read more fluently, so structure should be improved and the chapters should flow more naturually.

Abbreviations should be introduced in the paper, for example it is never explained that VM stands for Virtual Machine.

Citation should implemented as: as Author states (citation) …

Software has become fundamental to our daily lives should be cited.

“Contemporary” not modern word so better find another word.

“Sub questions” should be changed to “sub-questions”

Change "preliminaries" name to "trusted execution"

Sub conclusions should be called summary

Latex for picture instead of begin{figure}[h] begin{figure}[t]

Conclusion or summary should be under every chapter for consistency reasons
