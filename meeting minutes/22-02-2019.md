## BSc seminar - Meeting minutes 22 february 2019
### Discussion
We discussed that the members of our group are not familiar with blockchain technology. Because smart contracts is a more advanced topic, it was decided that the group would have to do some research and see if this would be a good fit. Therefore, the students will decide the topic of the paper prior to the next meeting. It was also agreed on to get more familiar with blockchain (and Ethereum in specific) and Mr de Vos recommended us some papers to read. In addition to this, we will also find literature related to blockchain and possibly related to our chosen topic.

### Points of action
- decide on research topic
- familiarize ourselves with blockchain technology
- gather and read related literature
